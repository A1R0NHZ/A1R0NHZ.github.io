<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am a researcher specializing in artificial intelligence and robotics, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at AMET University. I am actively looking for Master’s and Research Assistant opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.

My research journey has been guided by esteemed mentors, including <a href="https://kirim.kmutt.ac.th/converis/portal/detail/Person/54019785">Dr. Thawseeak Yingthorsuk</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ir-Dr-Malathy-Batumalay">Dr. Malathy Batumalay</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/duraimutharasan-bose-17728051">Dr. Duraimutharasan</a> . Under their supervision, I am exploring the intersection of Tsunami, mental health, physical sensors, and EEG technology through machine learning and deep learning methodologies. Additionally, I am delving into extremism detection, propaganda analysis, and radicalization through large language models. I have published three papers, with one paper accepted for presentation, and three additional papers currently under review.

I have a strong interest in developing innovative solutions that harness technology for social good, particularly in areas like mental health and security. I believe that collaborative research can lead to breakthroughs that address pressing challenges in our society.
