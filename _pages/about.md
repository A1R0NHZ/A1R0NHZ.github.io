<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am a Jr.researcher specializing in artificial intelligence and robotics, currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at AMET University. I am actively looking for Master’s and Research Assistant opportunities to further develop my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.

My research journey has been guided by esteemed mentors, including <a href="https://kirim.kmutt.ac.th/converis/portal/detail/Person/54019785">Dr. Thawseeak Yingthorsuk</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ir-Dr-Malathy-Batumalay">Dr. Malathy Batumalay</a> and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/duraimutharasan-bose-17728051">Dr. Duraimutharasan</a> . Under their supervision, I am exploring the intersection of Tsunami, mental health, physical sensors, and EEG technology through machine learning and deep learning methodologies. Additionally, I am delving into extremism detection, propaganda analysis, and radicalization through large language models. I have published three papers, with one paper accepted for presentation, and three additional papers currently under review. Driven by a commitment to social good, I am working toward the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and other key global initiatives. My research interests are centered on creating innovative solutions that address critical areas like mental health and security. I believe that collaborative research and technology can drive impactful solutions to today’s most pressing challenges.
