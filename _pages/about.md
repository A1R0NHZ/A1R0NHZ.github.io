<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi! I am an AI engineer and junior researcher specializing in artificial intelligence, robotics, and signal processing. I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science (Honors) in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at AMET University, Chennai, and am now focused on advancing my career through Master‚Äôs and Research Assistant opportunities.

Guided by distinguished mentors such as <a href="https://kirim.kmutt.ac.th/converis/portal/detail/Person/54019785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Thawseeak Yingthawornsuk</a>, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ir-Dr-Malathy-Batumalay" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Malathy Batumalay</a>, and <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/duraimutharasan-bose-17728051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Duraimutharasan</a>, my research covers advanced deep learning applications for tsunami prediction, mental health diagnosis using EEG and ECG signal analysis, and extremism detection via large language models.

I have authored over a dozen research papers, including award-winning studies on psychological stress detection, tsunami forecasting, and depression detection. My current focus includes developing lightweight AI models for edge deployment in biomedical signal processing, along with secure communication solutions for defense applications.

Motivated by a commitment to social impact and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), I strive to create AI-driven innovations that address healthcare, security, and disaster management challenges, with a strong emphasis on ethical, practical, and scalable technology solutions.

I believe collaboration and cutting-edge research are vital to solving today‚Äôs global challenges and responsibly advancing technology.
